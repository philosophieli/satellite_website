						<p>	
							This page provides a brief overview of eligibility/prerequisites and program costs. Please go to "<a href="apply.html">Application Instructions</a>" to find specific instructions for completing the application process and to register for on-campus housing.</p>
						<h3>Eligibility</h3>
						<p>	
							This training program is mainly intended for graduate students and post-graduate professionals, but bright undergraduates are also strongly encouraged to participate.</p>
						<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
						<p>
							Good python programming experience is helpful, but not required.</p>
						<h3>Selection</h3>
						<p>
							Selection of participants is based on a short e-mail explaining future goals and expectations from the course. The principle purpose of this evaluation is the ensure that the course will meet the expectations and needs of the prospective applicant.</p>
						<h3>Program Tuition</h3>
						<p>
							Program tuition is: <strong>$2,800</strong> 
							<br><br>
							<strong>NOTE: </strong> There are no funds available to provide financial aid for this course. Prospective participants are strongly encouraged to seek funds from their respective home institutions. I would be very happy to write a letter of support describing likely benefits the course would have for the participant's career AND the for the home institution's ability to develop and maintain a permanent remote sensing capability. <br>

						<h3>Housing</h3>
						<div class="flex flex-2">
							<article>
								<h4>Basic Dormitory Housing*</h4>
									<p>Description:	A block of single occupancy dormitory rooms have been reserved in Cascadilla Hall on the Cornell Campus. There are separate common-area bathroom facilities. These rooms are NOT air conditioned*.</p>
							</article>
							<article>
								<h4>Cost</h4>
									<p>Dormitory costs for the Summer 2017 are <strong>$52</strong> per night, and a one-time administrative fee of <strong>$32</strong> plus applicable sales tax.</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<p>
							<i>*While most days in Ithaca during June are pleasant (70 to 80 F), there can be occasional periods of very hot weather (90-100 F) making non-air conditioned dorm rooms particularly uncomfortable.</i></p>
						<h3>Off Campus Housing</h3>
						<p>
							Staying in campus dormitory housing is not mandatory. It is provided mainly as an easy way for you to secure housing for the course. 
							<br><br>
							Staying in the dorms is encouraged because it is a nice way to form a better camaraderie among fellow participants. However, if you prefer to stay at a local hotel, with air conditioning, you can use the <a href="http://www.visitithaca.com/lodging/search.cfm">Ithaca Area Accommodations Locator</a>. <i>Please be aware that the course will run during Cornell's Alumni Week which usually puts a heavy demand on area hotel availability so you are strongly encourage to make reservations early.</i>
							<br><br>
							If you prefer to search for a short-term summer sublet, you can search for availabilities by using the <a href="https://sf-sas-app-002.serverfarm.cornell.edu:7793/och/faces/adf.task-flow?adf.tfId=task-flow-definition6&ampadf.tfDoc=/WEB-INF/task-flow-definition6.xml">Off Campus Housing Web Site</a>.
							<br><br>
							You might also try <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a>.</p>
						<h3>Meals</h3>
						<p>
							Participants are expected to obtain meals from local food establishments or purchase a Cornell Meal Plan at their own expense.</p>
