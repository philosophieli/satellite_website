Directions On How To Add a New Year Of Students To Past Participants

1. Edit the "participants.txt" file so that it contains the name of the student then a tab then the college of the student then a new line 
***DO NOT PUT A NEW LINE AT THE END OF THE LAST LINE***
(ex. the current format of the file)

2. Run the python script entitled "participant_table_generator.py"

3. When you are prompted enter the title of the table, usually the season followed by the year (ex. Summer 2017)

4. Once the script has completed copy the results from the "participants.txt" file and paster them between line 40 and 41 in the "participants.html" file
***BE SURE TO PREFORM THE PASTE RIGHT AGAINST THE LEFT BORDER OF THE SCREEN IN OTHER WORDS WHEN YOU PAST HAVE NO TABS ON THE LINE WHEN YOU PASTE***

5. Check the results by opening the "participants.html" file in a web browser
